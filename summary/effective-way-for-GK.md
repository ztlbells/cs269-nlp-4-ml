Abstract
-------------
National Higher Education Entrance Examination, which is commonly knowns as Gaokao, is designed to be difficult enough to distinguish excellent high school students in China. The paper described Gaokao History Multiple Choice Questions(GKHMC) and proposed three approaches to address them. Approaches include Information Retrieval(IR), Neural Network(NN) and the combination of IR and NN. Results show that IR performs better at Entity Questions(EQs), while NN performs better at Sentence Questions(SQs). The combination method achieves state-of-art performance, showing the necessity to apply hybrid method when encountering real-world scenarios.
